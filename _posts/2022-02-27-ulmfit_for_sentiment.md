Universal Language Model Fine-tuning (ULMFiT)[^1] is an effective transfer learning approach for solving variety tasks in Natural Language Processing.
The authors shed some light on the three common tasks of text classification: sentiment analysis, question classification, and topic classification.
Especially, their work achieves state-of-the-art results on six text classification tasks.
