Based on the potentials and advantages of ADS-B data ,we propose in this paper a simplified and workable framework for air trajectories clustering which is one of the essential parts in the air management process. The experimental results, carried out using the data of three different pairs of airports, can show the effectiveness of our proposed framework, as well as the clustering results based on the combination of two different metrics. Finally, from using the interpolation considered in the framework, it is able to reduce significantly the complexity of data processing, which is very important in real application.
