I'm a Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer at the [Tenpoint7](http://www.tenpoint7.com/)/[Addy.ai](http://addy.ai/). I mostly focus in extracting valuable insights. The techniques involve supervised and un-supervised learning, anomaly detection methods, feature selection, evaluation methods, and probably almost anything on the range from data observing and extraction to results evaluation and visualization. Before, I did a Master in Computer Science under the supervision of [An Mai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/an-mai-549997103/). I have background in Computer Network and Machine Learning, particularly in Applying Machine Learning to solve real business problems.
